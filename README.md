## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- SASS/SCSS preprocessor
- Workflow shared between different SCSS files

### What I learned

I had trouble using opacity properties for hover nft divs, but hsla() function came in handy and I was able to make semi-transparent background and not transparent eye (view) icon. Sometimes it's more worth it to use opacity built in hsla and rgba than opacity CSS property.

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  background-color: hsla(255,255,255,0.5)
}
```
